Task:

You must generate exactly 5 JSON objects, each representing one test case.

Each JSON object must follow this exact structure:

{
"input": {
"args": [...] # Values for the function arguments, in the correct order
},
"output": {
"expected": ... # The exact return value after executing the function with these args
}
}

Combine all 5 objects into a single JSON array:

[
{ ... },
{ ... },
{ ... },
{ ... },
{ ... }
]

Requirements:

The function name and its argument list are already provided. Do not infer or detect them.

Your job is only to:
(a) Generate valid input values for the arguments.
(b) Simulate the function exactly as Python would execute it.
(c) Compute the correct return value.

The simulation must follow Python's exact execution order, including how string slicing and iteration affect indices after mutation.

The final output must be valid JSON that can be parsed by json.loads().

Output JSON only. Do not include explanations, markdown, comments, or any extra text.
